## Problem Description

The current implementation in the phosphor-host-postd for postcode based on the LPC port 80 
connected b/w BMC and single host.

It is required to develop a new mechanism that would allow to read port 80 post code 
from multiple-host through BIC(Bridge IC) using IPMI protocol.

## Background and References

Facebook Yosemitev2 had an internal solution already for the problem and solution may to add 
into phosphor-host-postd and phosphor-post-code-manager.

The below device entry added in tiogapass DTS to create the LPC device(aspeed-lpc-snoop) in /dev

&lpc_snoop {
    status = "okay";
    snoop-ports = <0x80>;
};

GPIOs for 7 segment Display:
&gpio {
       status = "okay";
       gpio-line-names =
       /*H0-H7*/       "LED_POST_CODE_0","LED_POST_CODE_1","LED_POST_CODE_2",
                       "LED_POST_CODE_3","LED_POST_CODE_4","LED_POST_CODE_5",
                       "LED_POST_CODE_6","LED_POST_CODE_7";
}; 

snoopd daemon opens the lpc snoop character device( -lpc) and it owns the dbus object
whose value is the latest port 80h value.

**"/xyz/openbmc_project/state/boot/raw"**

These string constants are only used in this method within this object
and this object is the only object feeding into the final binary.

**"xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.Raw"**

If however, another object is added to this binary it would be proper
to move these declarations to be global and extern to the other object.

**phosphor-post-code-manager** 

This daemon [phosphor-post-code-manager](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-post-code-manager) monitors post code posted on dbus interface /xyz/openbmc_project/state/boot/raw by snoopd daemon [phosphor-host-postd](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-postd)
and save them in a file under /var/lib/phosphor-post-code-manager for history.

Every power cycle in host, post codes are saved as file in **/var/lib/phosphor-post-code-manager** on BMC.

The below files strored as Non-persistence storage in BMC.
 
  "1" file is saved all post codes for power cycle 1
  "2" file is saved all post codes for power cycle 2
  "3" file is saved all post codes for power cycle 3
   .                                         .
   .                                         .
  "100" file is saved all post codes for cycle 100

  "CurrentBootCycleIndex" file is saved the current boot cycle number
  "CurrentBootCycleCount" file is saved the current boot cycle count

BootCycleCount's max count is 100.

## Requirements

 - Send POST code to 8-segment LED display on Debug Card.
 -  The POST code has to be from one of the server selected based on manual selection switch at front panel in debug card.
 - Provide a command for user to read current postcode.
 - POST code history.
 - Provide a command for user to see the all postcode for any given server.

##  fb-ipmi-oem

 - Register Bridge IC OEM callback interrupt handler for a postcode(cmd = 0x08, netfn=0x38, lun=00).
 - Extract port 80 data from IPMI response based on length.
 - Send extracted postcode to fb-yv2-misc.

## fb-yv2-misc implementation

 - Get Bridge IC configuration(cmd = 0x0E, netfn=0x38, lun=00).
 - Set Bridge IC configuration(cmd = 0x10, netfn=0x38, lun=00).
 - Create, register and add dbus connection for "/xyz/openbmc_project/state/boot/raw".
 - Add "Value" property to store current postcode from hostX(X=1,2,3,4).
 - Read each hosts postcode data from fb-ipmi-oem postcode interrupt handler.
 - Read host position from debug card.
 - Display current post-code into the 7 segment display connected to GPIOs based on the host selection.
 - Generate postcode event to post-code-manager by update postcode into "Value" property.

## postcode-manager implementation
Change single process into a multi-process to handle multi-host postcode history.

## Alternatives Considered
Considered using to read post-code directly from Bridge IC under [fb-yv2-misc](https://github.com/HCLOpenBMC/fb-yv2-misc) instead of using [fb-ipmi-oem](https://github.com/openbmc/fb-ipmi-oem).
